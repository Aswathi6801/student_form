🎓 Student Form Project
A clean, interactive Student Registration Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice form handling, DOM manipulation, and dynamic table management with a modern UI.

🚀 Features
✅ User-Friendly Form – Collects:
      🧑 Name
      🎂 Age
      🚻 Gender
      🧑‍💻 Course
      📧 Email

✅ Dynamic Table: Displays submitted student details in a structured table
✅ One-Click Delete: Easily remove any student entry with a single click
✅ Form Reset: Clears fields automatically after saving
✅ Prevents Page Refresh: Uses e.preventDefault() for seamless interaction
✅ Clean, Responsive Design: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile
✅ Animated Buttons: Interactive save and delete buttons for a smooth experience

🛠️ Technologies Used
   🖼️ HTML: For structuring the form and table
   🎨 CSS: For styling, layout, and responsiveness
   ⚡ JavaScript: For DOM manipulation and interactivity

✨ Enhanced Button Experience
💾 Save Button
  Behavior: Adds your entry to the student list without refreshing the page

🗑️ Delete Button
    Uses event.target for precise row removal without reloading

🎯 How It Works
1️⃣ User fills out the student form with required details
2️⃣ On clicking Save, data is dynamically:

Captured using JavaScript

Inserted as a new row in the student table

Fields reset for a fresh new entry

3️⃣ Users can remove any entry by clicking the 🗑️ Delete button for that row.
